      </a></p>
      
<p align="justify" class="style18">
  The main theme of my work is safety and soundness, and the emphasis is on safe autonomy through correct-by-construction algorithmic approaches.
  In my research, I integrate control theory and formal methods to form powerful frameworks that enable autonomy in achieving complex tasks through high-level decision making with the awareness of low-level complexities and constraints of the physical systems.
  <!-- My research focuses on the employment of formal methods in automatic control generation for dynamical systems with correctness and completeness guarantees. --> 
</p>

<p align="justify" class="style18">
  My Ph.D. dissertation proposes a computationally tractable formal verification and synthesis method for stochastic systems with applications in robotics.  My postdoctoral work revolves around temporal logic motion planning for complex dynamical systems under various types of uncertainty.
  Currently, I focus on developing algorithms that guarantee safety and integrity of mobile robots in their interactions with humans through cognitive models, stochastic games, and correct-by-construction embedded software components.
