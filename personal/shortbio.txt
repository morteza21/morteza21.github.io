Morteza Lahijanian is an assistant professor in the Aerospace Engineering Sciences department, an affiliated faculty at the Computer Science department, and the director of the Assured, Reliable, and Interactive Autonomous (ARIA) Systems group at the University of Colorado Boulder. He received a B.S. in Bioengineering at the University of California, Berkeley and a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Boston University. He served as a postdoctoral scholar in Computer Science at Rice University. Prior to joining CU Boulder, he was a research scientist in the department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford. His awards include Ella Mae Lawrence R. Quarles Physical Science Achievement Award, Jack White Engineering Physics Award, NSF GK-12 Fellowship, and Wadham College Research Fellowship. Dr. Lahijanian's research interests span the areas of control theory, stochastic hybrid systems, formal methods, machine learning, and game theory with applications in robotics, particularly, motion planning, strategy synthesis, model checking, and human-robot interaction. His lab develops novel theoretical foundations and computational frameworks to enable reliable and intelligent autonomy. The emphasis is especially on safe autonomy through correct-by-construction algorithmic approaches.
