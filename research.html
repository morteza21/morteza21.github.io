      My research group, <a href="https://www.ariasystems.group/">ARIA Systems</a>, focuses on developing novel theoretical foundations and computational frameworks to enable reliable and intelligent autonomy. The main theme of our work is safety and soundness, and the emphasis is on safe autonomy through correct-by-construction algorithmic approaches. We are housed in the Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder, and our research builds on knowledge developed in control theory, formal methods, statistical reasoning, machine learning & AI to address real-world challenges in robotics and safety-critical systems.</p>

By using tools from formal methods, concurrency,  and control theory, we extend motion specification languages to arbitrary  temporal and logic statements given in human-like language, and develop tools  for provably correct automatic deployment of robots from such specifications.  Our approach includes two steps: (1) abstraction  of the motion of the probabilistic robot (continuous stochastic system) in a  partitioned environment (state space) into Markov models and (2) control of such models using  formal (temporal logic) approaches.</p>

      <p align="justify" class="style20">In the classical robotic motion planning problem, a  specification is given simply as “go from A to B while avoiding obstacles”. However,  a real mission might be significantly more complicated than this.  For instance, it could involve a sequential  visit of multiple regions (“reach A, and then B, and then C”), convergence to a  region (“reach A and stay there for all the future times”), perform  surveillance among different regions (visit A and B infinitely often), or even  more complicated statements (“Go to A. Don’t go to B unless C or D was visited”).  Such expressivity can be achieved through the use of temporal logics such as  Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and Computation Tree Logic (CTL).  In the recent years, there have been major  developments in utilizing these languages in the field of model checking and  formal analysis.  We use algorithms  inspired from this field to find motion plans and control strategies from such  specifications.</p>

        <p align="justify" class="style20">An increasing number of algorithms have been proposed to find motion plans and control strategies from complex specifications.  The majority of these algorithms, however, make limiting assumptions like simple (linear) dynamics or the existence of a finite set of discrete motion primitives (control actions) for the robot.  In our work, we avoid making such assumptions and consider high dimensional systems with general (complex, possibly nonlinear and hybrid) dynamics.  In our current framework, we are able to automatically generate a motion plan and the necessary control actions for a robot to satisfy an LTL formula defined over regions of the environment. Satisfaction is achieved by combining high-level discrete planning with low-level continuous planning through the use of specification-automaton approaches to formal synthesis and sampling-based motion-planning techniques. As a result, we can support any type of robot model with arbitrarily complex dynamics, including hybrid systems and high-level specifications with compound temporal goals.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="style20"><img src="images/SyCLoP_diagram1.png" alt="SyCLoP_diagram" width="400" height="215" hspace="10" align="right" />The search for a valid motion is done by augmenting a multi-layered synergistic framework called SyCLoP. SyCLoP was  proposed to solve classical &quot;A to B&quot; motion-planning problems and  yields orders of magnitude speedup over traditional sampling-based motion-planning techniques. The augmented framework that includes the logic specification and the SyCLoP framework is shown to the right and consists of three main layers:</p>
<p align="justify" class="style20"><strong>(a) High-level search layer:</strong> This is the layer that uses the automaton obtained by the considered logic formula,  a discrete abstraction for the robot model,  and the exploration information from the low-level search layer to construct high-level plans. In contrast to existing approaches, this layer differs in the fact that it incorporates the exploration information from
          the low-level search layer as well.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="style20"><strong>(b) Low-level search layer:</strong> The low-level search layer is the layer that accounts for the physics of the problem. This layer takes into account the robot dynamics and the geometric constraints while exploring the physical space for 
          feasible trajectories. The layer uses suggested high-level plans to 
          explore the state space
          for solution trajectories.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>(c) Synergy layer:</strong> The synergy layer is an intermediate layer that facilitates the synergistic interaction between the high-level and the low-level search layers. This layer is a critical component of the overall framework.</p>

        <p align="justify" class="style20">The starting point for this work is to abstract the evolution  of the system (robot) in the (partitioned) state pace (environment) as a Markov model.  To achieve this, we make the assumption that  despite input noise (noisy sensors in the case of robot), current region in the  state space can be determined precisely.  This assumption  is not overly restrictive for indoor navigation applications where, for  instance, a large number of RFID tags can be placed in the environment. Thus,  the robot motion plan becomes a Markov Decision Process (MDP).</p>

        <p align="justify" class="style20">To experimentally validate our approach, we utilize  primarily the Robotic InDoor Environment (RIDE). RIDE is an experimental platform designed to  generate control action transition probabilities and test temporal logic-based  control strategies that utilize those probabilities. The goal is to  autonomously deploy a robot that executes a rich, human-like logic  specification within a given environment using a control strategy that  maximizes the probability of satisfying the specification. <br />
          <br />
        This system utilizes pieces of extruded polystyrene as  building blocks, allowing environments of different geometries to be easily  constructed. The mobile platform is an iRobot Create fitted with a laser range  finder, an RFID reader, and a netbook. It can move autonomously through  corridors and intersections that can be easily reconfigured. <br />
        <br />
        The robotic setup allows for actuation noise (i.e., the control actions enable  transitions with known probabilities) and/or uncertain knowledge of current  region - two major limitations of existing temporal logic approaches that focus  on guaranteed (deterministic) transition systems and knowledge of precise  location - in order to generate a control strategy for a Markov Decision  Process (MDP).<br />
        <br />
    RIDE is also equipped with a simulator that can be used to help generate the  MDP model and to test the produced control strategies.</p>
